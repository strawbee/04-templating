# 04 - Templating
**Author**: Joy Hou, Joe Waine, and Garrett Johnson
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
We are using HandlebarsJS template to render HTML and loop through data. We refactored our previous script using JS/jQuery.

## Getting Started
1. Add in a link to HandlebarsJS.
2. Add a script in the head that holds the Handlebars template.
3. Add an empty div to hold the actual HTML that will be generated in the body.
4. Render the HTML in the JS file using Handlebars scripting.

## Architecture
We are using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We are using normalize.css, jQuery, and HandlebarsJS.
